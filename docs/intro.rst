    It looks like crap in a text editor, but it has no effect on rendering, and it allows much more useful diffs.

Introduction
============

``django-emojiwatch`` is a bare bones Slack app for posting custom emoji updates to a designated channel.
It is implemented as a Django app.
It was loosely inspired by Khan Academy's |emojiwatch|_, which provides similar functionality, but for hosting on on Google App Engine.

.. |emojiwatch| replace:: ``emojiwatch``
.. _`emojiwatch`: https://github.com/Khan/emojiwatch

License
-------

``django-emojiwatch`` is licensed under the `MIT License <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_.
See the :doc:`LICENSE <LICENSE>` file for details.
Source code is `available on GitHub <https://github.com/posita/django-emojiwatch>`__.

Installation
------------

Django
~~~~~~

Installation can be performed via ``pip`` (which will download and install the `latest release <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-emojiwatch/>`__):

.. code-block:: console

    % pip install django-emojiwatch
    ...

Alternately, you can download the sources (e.g., `from GitHub <https://github.com/posita/django-emojiwatch>`__) and run ``setup.py``:

.. code-block:: console

    % git clone https://github.com/posita/django-emojiwatch
    ...
    % cd django-emojiwatch
    % python setup.py install
    ...

Now you can add it to your ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'emojiwatch',
    )

    EMOJIWATCH = {
        'slack_verification_token': '...',
    }

And add it to your site-wide URLs:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.conf.urls import include, url

    urlpatterns = (
        # ...
        url(
            r'^emojiwatch/',  # or werever you want
            include('emojiwatch.urls'),
        ),
        # ...
    )

If you haven't already, you'll also need to `enable the admin site <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/admin/#overview>`__ for your Django installation.

Configuring Token Encryption in Django's Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, workspace IDs will be encrypted using a hash of the ``SECRET_KEY`` Django setting.
To override this, use the ``FERNET_KEYS`` setting. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from os import environ
    SECRET_KEY = environ['SECRET_KEY']
    # Use only Base64-encoded 32 byte values for keys; don't derive them
    # from arbitrary strings
    FERNET_USE_HKDF = False
    # For supporting any legacy keys that were used when FERNET_USE_HKDF
    # was True
    from fernet_fields.hkdf import derive_fernet_key
    # The keys
    FERNET_KEYS = [
        # The first entry is the current key (for encrypting and
        # decrypting)
        environ['FERNET_KEY'],
        # Optional additional entries are older keys for decrypting only
        # environ['OLD_FERNET_KEY_1'],
        # Equivalent to the default key
        # derive_fernet_key(SECRET_KEY),
    ]

See `the docs <http://django-fernet-fields.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#keys>`__ for details.

Slack App Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For illustration, we'll create a `workspace-based Slack app <https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types#workspace>`__, but we could just as easily use a traditional one.

TODO: Finish this section.

Requirements
------------

You'll a Slack account (and admin approval) for setting up your app.
A modern version of Python is required:

*   `cPython <https://www.python.org/>`_ (2.7 or 3.4+)

*   `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_ (Python 2.7 or 3.4+ compatible)

``django-emojiwatch`` has the following dependencies (which will be installed automatically):

*   |Django|_ (1.8 or higher)
*   |djang-fernet-fields|_
*   |future|_
*   |slacker|_
